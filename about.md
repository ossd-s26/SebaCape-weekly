Hello, my name is Sebastian. I am currently a second year at NYU pursuing a joint degree in Computer & Data Science, and I am currently enrolled in CSCI-UA 480 - Open Source Software Development.

### More Information

Some things I like are music production, playing the banjo, game development, cooking, going to the gym, and reading. I hope to explore systems engineering and data engineering more rigorously over this semester.
