title: Week 4, Version Control and Project Contribution
---
### Git Exercises
I already had a decent amount of familiarity with version control, and Git more specifically before coming into this course,
but I do think that the exercises still taught me some extra tidbits of useful information that I will most definitely use
in the future (and in some cases have already started using.) Commands like git reset & git diff were ones that I was not
aware of the use cases for, so those were quite interesting to see in action, and I look forward to becoming even more 
masterful at the technology as time goes on in this class.

### Project Evaluation
The project that my group evaluated was exercism, which seemed interesting, but unfortunately seems like it would be difficult
to interface with and contribute to. However, there are also projects like Godot and Cirq, that seem accessible all around and
also hold a lot of my interest, being related to game development and quantum computing respectively. I really look forward 
to contributing to a project because I want to understand what the workflow is like for making contributions to tools used by
thousands if not millions of people, and I am eager to finally have my work make an impact in some way shape or form. I think
the biggest challenge for any project would probably be getting acclimated to the documentation so I could begin actually
making meaningful contributions. The only way to really overcome this is with time and dedication, which I plan to exert to
create meaningful software and supporting documents.
