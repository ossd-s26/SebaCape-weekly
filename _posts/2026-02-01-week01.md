title: Week 2, Codes of Conduct
---
### This post is in reference to our class activity in CS-480 OSSD in reviewing codes of conduct.

Starting with an open source software as robust as go, we can see the code of conduct not necessarily being overtly explicit on the types of contributions that are allowed. Rather, a heavy emphasis is placed on the social etiquette of contributors. A likely purpose for this is to minimize a baseline level of alienation within any community surrounding any given open source software, and in retrospect, this makes a lot of sense. If you scare away new contributors with your culture, then your technology is less likely to have newfound ideas brought upon it, and thus its quality will eventually stagnate (which is the exact opposite of what is trying to be achieved with open source.)

Continuing to look further into Go's code of conduct, we can find that it has actually been adapted from the contributer covenant base code of conduct document, with the primary change that the "enforcement" section has been altered to "conflict resolution," likely to convey a less punishing tone regarding community guideline infractions.

Eclipse has also adapted from this code of conduct, but it primarily differs from Go's on the basis of having more restrictions on contributor behavior, even going so far as to include the aforementioned enforcement section as opposed to altering it in the case of go. My hypothesis is that this difference likely arose through the difference in management and development of the companies that founded these open source technologies (Google and IBM respectively,) and this dichotomy of culture leads to a slightly different set of values being enforced, even if there is similarity.

This can be seen further with the Sugar Labs code of conduct, which follows a template completely unique to the previously mentioned one, as it is based off of the Ubuntu code of conduct. The main overarching difference with this code of conduct is that respectfulness is left a lot more to the fair judgement of the contributor, as opposed to the previous codes, which have some explicit examples of what is not at all tolerated.

Looking at another open source project from Google in Cirq, we find that the code of conduct is actually identical to Go's code of conduct, further reinforcing the fact that codes founded by different people and organizations are quite likely to have variance primarily based on the founders values. Thus, there is actually no necessity to alter Cirq's code of conduct from Go's, as the same moral principles and social etiquette holds.

Prior to this activity I had never really thought of open source software doubling as a community as well and needing guidelines for behavior by extension, but in retrospect it makes a lot of sense. I hope to come back with more insights to the nature of these technologies as I progress through this course.
